# WP exceptions management
This WP plugin intercepts, log and show PHP exceptions in WP.

# How to use the folder /use-this-file-when-necessary
If some exception makes WP unusable, you can still read the logs using php-log.php (install it into the plugin folder when necessary).

# Install
Install the plugin in WP like you use to do. Create the folders "log/logs" and set the permission to allow the script to write inside this folder.
